nature is my inspiration, with all the beauty and variety of colors and compositions.

There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
There is society, where none intrudes,
By the deep sea, and music in its roar:
I love not man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne’er express, yet cannot all conceal.

Lord Byron

I live in the world today and currently based in Bali, Indonesia. 
But there are places on Earth, I attached with by my soul. It’s villa Gaia 
in Tuscany I lived for few years. I love Lofoten islands, with their remarkable 
atmosphere of fishing villages, sailing adventures, incredible hikes 
and northern lights dances during the winter time.

The world can’t live without testimonials, so I should place here a few words on awards 
and publications. I have publications in such magazines as Digital SLR Magazine, 
UK, Photography week, Photography Master Class, National Geographic, Discovery,
 Photoworld China, Digital Photo (Bauer Media) magazines. My key clients are Apple,
  Gazprom Neft’, S7 Airlines, RedBull, HSBC.

I am spending most of his time in Norway at Lofoten islands and in Tuscany at our
 villa Gaia, guiding groups from Europe, UK, US, Asia . I am official Nikon, Gitzo and
  Lucroit ambassador.

What is the difference between workshop, tour and expedition?
Workshop: we have a very light schedule, and in between sessions we spend lots of time on lessons, processing instruction. We have time to teach each other in-fields. Usually have only 1-2 bases. Suitable starting from very beginners. Most amazing workshops for beginners are Tuscany and Lofoten.
Tour: We bring you at amazing locations at exact time! We help you to setup cameras and travel a lot at places we know well. We are short in time to make so many tuition sessions as we can do during workshop. We work altogether in the field . Suitable for beginners.
Expedition: we use all our time to work hard on our photography! We have almost no time for tuition, but we work shoulder to shoulder, sharing our secrets and tips. You may always consult with a leader. You should know your camera settings very well, it is not suitable for beginners. If you are beginner you can join the expedition, but do not expect that we will have plenty of time for tuition. Expedition schedule is usually packed with hikes, sessions and hard work on a subject shoulder to shoulder.
Photography tours and workshops are the best way to travel with fellow photographers. We have a special schedule that help you to take best possible photos. We usually learn a lot from each other and have so much fun!

Kate Holstein is an American photographer who lives between Aspen, Colorado and the Caribbean island of Saint Barthélemy. She was trained at The Parsons School of Design in New York City. However, it was the experience following school, while living in Paris then traveling the world, where she truly discovered her eye.



Kate photographs a broad range of subjects, from celebrity portraiture to editorial work for clients such as Condé Nast Traveler and Cereal Magazine. She is best known for her unique take on landscapes and cityscapes, which through her lens appear etherial, luminous, and evoke a deep sense of place. Her upbringing in the mountains of Colorado, along with a brief career as a professional skier, have greatly influenced her landscape work. It was this time spent in nature as a child and young adult that gave her the unique gift to capture the very essence of it.



Shooting exclusively with natural light, she finds beauty in the subtle, which brings an organic and captivating quality to her work. Her landscapes have become collected photography, and are currently sold through Galleries in NYC, St. Barth, The Hamptons, Aspen, Charleston and California.



Recently she contributed to Assouline’s ASPEN STYLE book. Her work is also seen in THESE ISLANDS published by Cereal Magazine along with their celebrated city guides for Paris and New York.

Elizabeth Gadd is an artist/photographer based in Vancouver, Canada, who feels most at home in the mountains, forests, fields and ocean - all of which are heavily incorporated into her photography. 

She combines self portraiture with real landscapes (often spending days at a time in the wilderness), creating ethereal images that evoke peaceful solitude and portray the beauty of matching one's 
heartbeat with the beat of nature.  This niche of Lizzy's photography has been described as whimsical, dreamy, fairy-tale-like and full of wanderlust - drawing an organic accumulation of 700,000+

nature and themselves: To channel feeling through photography - to find value in 
what's vulnerable - to find peace in the presence of nature. And to walk forward with love,
 gentleness and respect for ourselves and this beautiful earth we call home.

EVOKE A DESIRE & INSPIRE.
Daniel Ernst is a commercial photographer and filmmaker based in Germany. With a dedication to the outdoors and meaningful storytelling, Daniels work has lead him to many remote places around the world especially drawn to the Nordic regions. Inspired by nature, his work mainly focuses on the outdoors, adventure and lifestyle.

'With my photography and stories I want to inspire people, evoke a desire, a motivation to leave the rush behind, escape routine, go outdoors, explore and experience nature. We are fortunate to be presented with many opportunities in this world, it's just about making them into reality. Storytelling as a tool to allow people to live through my images and videos, I think that’s the most powerful essence of my work, when it comes down to one point.'

Giulia Gartner

We are a product of our environment, probably more than we'd care to admit. Growing up in a small village by the mountains of the Italian Dolomites helped me shape a profound yet playful relationship with nature....


The unique culture, impressive and almost imposing mountains masked by an open field paved the way for my creative upbringing. This environment allowed my visual sensations to blossom and gave free rein to my artistic inclinations.

I have always been drawn to artistic mediums that can evoke feelings. So when I picked up a camera for the first time, it truly felt like magic.

I shared how I perceive my everyday life with others – colorful, calm, yet ever-moving. I never liked to sit there, trying to explain. Instead, I want to show it, visually.
‍
The hunt for impactful moments sparked my curiosity to venture beyond the horizons and chase it to the edge of the world. As a result, my creative appetite has spread over to other mediums such as filmmaking, film photography, design, podcasting, music, and going on the hunt for the best pancakes on the planet.



I discovered that extreme conditions and sleepless nights are an inseparable part of capturing striking images. I've learned to adapt and deal with difficult situations. I've lost sleep while laying on cold floors, changed flat tires while baking under the sun, and broke my wallet spending way too much on film rolls. But, I also learned when to hit the brakes and sip a Margarita by the pool.

Life never stops being interesting. There is always something that catches my attention, and I never stop freezing moments in time. Perhaps, I thought I would have seen it all one day, but the reality is far from it. More adventures await, and I would love you to venture with me on this journey.
